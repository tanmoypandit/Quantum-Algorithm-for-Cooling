# Quantum-Algorithm-for-Cooling
We propose and numerically investigate sympathetic cooling schemes for quantum spin chains and molecular systems using a qutrit ancilla with engineered dissipation. Specifically, we study the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, and the hydrogen molecule $(H\textsubscript{2})$ in a two-qubit Jordan-Wigner-encoded form. In all cases, the ancilla acts as an energy sink, extracting heat via tunable local interactions. We compare two dissipation strategies: (i) local dissipation through the qutrit ancilla alone, and (ii) enhanced dissipation via an added collective decay channel. Our results show that while the qutrit alone provides effective cooling, a small amount of collective dissipation further improves energy extractionâ€”particularly for gapped systems like TFIM. For the $H\textsubscript{2}$ molecule, we demonstrate significant cooling from an initially excited state using ancilla-assisted dissipation. Parameters are optimized using Bayesian techni
